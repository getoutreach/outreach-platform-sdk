Outreach Platform API
-----------------

Outreach is a communication workflow solution for enterprise sales teams, which can be used as a standalone application, or in conjunction with [Outreach Everywhere](https://outreach.io/everywhere/) (our Chrome extension) to layer functionality on top of other services, including Salesforce, Linkedin, Gmail and more.

To get started with the Outreach API, please fill out out the [API Access Request Form](http://goo.gl/forms/RWk35DeZAK)

For information about the Outreach API, see [here](https://github.com/getoutreach/outreach-platform-sdk/blob/master/documentation/).  For information about authentication/authorization, see our [OAuth documentation](https://github.com/getoutreach/outreach-platform-sdk/blob/master/documentation/authorization/oauth.md)

If you would like more information on our technology or how Outreach can integrate with your existing sales infrastructure, get in touch with our [platform team](mailto:platform@outreach.io).
